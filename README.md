# Library-Management-System

A simple, yet effective, library management system that runs entirely in the command line. This application allows users to manage a collection of books, track issued books, and handle returns without the need for a database or external dependencies beyond the `pandas` library.

  

## Demonstration

Here's a quick look at the application's main menu and how to interact with it:
